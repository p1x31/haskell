This includes parts 1 and 2 of the 2nd assessed exercise. An advanced
set for high 1st class is missing and will be given in the second week
of the exercise. With the current set here, you will be able to get a
low 1st class mark.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
  Preparation for the exercise
--------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) First install the sample solutions module with command

    $ sh install.sh

This will create some subdirectories that you don't need to look at
(but you may).

(2) This will allows you to run this file with the command

    $ ghci -package-db=Bram/ghc Scrabble

(3) At the moment, your exercises below are solved by ourselves, so
that you can run them and see what output is expected. You will need
to replace lines "Bram.*" by your own code (or keep them if you are
not solving a particular exercise). All exercises are labeled by the
word "exercise" in a comment.

(4) Also we provide below code for you to use.

(5) In the first deadline, we expect you to submit this file with
about half of the questions answered.

(6) In the second and last deadline, you should submit this file again,
with all the work you managed to do.

(7) There will be an additional set of advanced exercises to get a
high 1st class mark. With this set, you will be able to get a low 1st
class mark.

(8) The sample solutions module only works in the lab, and also only after
module load ghc. If you want to work elsewhere, or if you want to double check
that your solutions don't depend on the Bram module, you can replace "import
qualified Bram" by "import qualified Blank as Bram", and run ghci using "ghci
Scrabble.hs". Sample solutions will then be unavailable to ghci.

  The Exercise - Scrabble
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The exercise is based on the game Scrabble aka Words with Friends.

Scrabble is quite a complicated game to implement, so we change a few
rules to simplify it. We call the new game "SCRABOL". This game is
very similar to Scrabble, with a couple of exceptions listed below. In
particular, there are no blanks and parallel words are forbidden.

That is, in Scrabble but not in SCRABOL, you can make the following
play (indicated in uppercase):


      b
      e
      t
      t
    W e
    A r
    X
    Y


In Scrabble this is valid because the following three words are valid
words: WE, AR, WAXY. But in our game, SCRABOL, this is not valid. In
SCRABOL, only the following kind of play is allowed:

      b
      e
      t
      t
    W e A T H E R
      r

Or:

      b
      e
      t
      t
      e
    W r I T T E N

(Parallel play example adapted from
http://blog.xjtian.com/post/51339158829/a-smarter-scrabble-ai-part-2-move-validation .)

If you are not familiar with Scrabble, have a go online a bit to get a feel
for the game, for instance at https://www.lexulous.com/ . (Warning: in
Lexulous, you have 8 letters on your rack, whereas we always have 7.) You can
also run the following command in ghci to play against the sample solution:

    playAgainstYourself sowpods "helloworld"

The rules of Scrabble are given here: http://scrabble.hasbro.com/en-us/rules .
The rules of SCRABOL are the same, with these exceptions, to make the game simpler:

Setup
    The game consists of an infinite board and any number of players. The
    dictionary will be given to you.

rule #1 (about playing words):
    For SCRABOL, parallel words are not allowed. That is, all words on the
    board stay unchanged, and exactly one word is added, intersecting with
    exactly one existing tile on the board.

rule #2 (about completing a turn):
    We don't draw the letter tiles from a fixed pool of 100 tiles, but the
    computer randomly generates tiles (using the same frequency).

rule #6 (about blanks)
    goes away, we don't have blanks.

rule #8 (about challenging a play)
    becomes irrelevant; word validity is checked by the computer.

rule #9 (about ending a game) becomes
    The game ends after a predetermined number of turns. We will determine
    this number later, it depends on how fast our program will run.

-- In SCRABOL, this is when two conditions hold.

--
--   2) Consider the positions directly adjacent to where the word is supposed
--      to go on the north, east, south, and west side (we ignore the
--      corners). Those positions must be empty, with two exceptions. If the
--      word goes horizontally, then the positions just north and south of the

-- There is a predefined monad for randomness. However, we are going

-- works better with laziness, but this is not exploited in this
-- exercise).
--
--   https://hackage.haskell.org/package/MonadRandomLazy-0.1/docs/Control-Monad-LazyRandom.html
--
-- instead, defined below.


-- We use the standard random generator as our type of seeds for
-- random things:

type Seed = StdGen

-- We get seeds for random-thing generation from Int's:

mkSeed :: Int -> Seed
mkSeed = mkStdGen

-- See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_seed
-- We define the monad as follows:

newtype LRand a = LRand (Seed -> a)

instance Functor LRand where
 fmap f (LRand h) = LRand (f.h)

instance Applicative LRand where
 pure  = return
 (<*>) = ap

instance Monad LRand where
 return x = LRand (\seed -> x)  -- The seed is ignored.

 LRand m >>= k =                -- The seed is not only used, but also transformed and propagated.
   LRand (\s ->
     let (s1,s2)  = split s     -- The split function is predefined in the random libraries. Hoogle it.
         LRand m' = k (m s1)
      in m' s2
   )

-- The following are to "get out" this monad:

evalRand :: LRand a -> Seed -> a
evalRand (LRand f) s = f s

-- What this says is that if you have a random element of type a (that
-- is, something of type LRand a), one way to get something of type a
-- is to provide a seed.

-- This is like the above, but also produces a new seed, if we need it:

runRand :: LRand a -> Seed -> (a, Seed)
runRand (LRand f) s = (f s1, s2)
 where (s1, s2) = split s

-- If we have access to IO, we can generate a new seed, use it, and throw away the modified seed:
runRandIO :: LRand a -> IO a
runRandIO gen = do
  seed <- newStdGen
  let (value, _) = runRand gen seed
  return value

-- And finally we need to be able to generate random elements:

getRandom :: Random a => LRand a
getRandom = LRand $ fst . random

-- But this needs to be in the Random type class. Most types are
-- automatically there, and it is unlikely you will need to worry
-- about this in this exercise, unless you do very sophisticated
-- things.

-- We also may need to get random elements within a range:

getRandomR :: Random a => (a,a) -> LRand a
getRandomR range = LRand $ fst . randomR range

-- This is the end of our definition of our lazy randomness monad.

pickUniformly :: [a] -> LRand a
pickUniformly xs = do
   n <- getRandomR (0, length xs - 1)
   return(xs !! n)

  return . fst . head $ dropWhile (\(_,q) -> q < p) cs

-- Exercise, hard.
--
-- Say that we have the following row on our board:
--
--     X - - - - - - - E - - - - - - X
--
-- We're wondering which words would fit there, overlapping with the
-- E. The word 'elsewhere' has four Es, and fits in two ways, namely
-- with the middle two E's. (As always in SCRABOL, when you play a
-- word they must overlap with exactly one tile on the board, so
-- 'xenophobe' would not fit here.)
--
-- Given an "intersection letter" (in this case E), and the number of
-- free spaces around it, find all the words that would fit in such a
-- space. Also, give all the positions where that letter is anchored;
-- in the example, 'elsewhere' can be anchored at positions 3 or 6.
--
-- In this example, the number of free spaces is 6 and 5,
-- respectively, because we must leave some space around the Xes.
--
-- allWords2 dict 'e' 6 5 = [..., ("elsewhere", 3), ("elsewhere", 6"), ...]
--
-- allWords2 dict 'x' 1 2 = [("ax", 2), ("axe", 2), ("axed", 2),
--    ("axes", 2), ("axis", 2), ("axle", 2), ("axon", 2), ("ex", 2), ("exam",
--    2), ("exec", 2), ("exes", 2), ("exit", 2), ("expo", 2), ("ox", 2),
--    ("oxen", 2), ("x", 1)]
--
-- (You may give the words in a different order.)

-- Exercise, medium.
--
-- Same, but only consider words that can be made using the given rack.
